# Circle Drawer – Java Swing Application

## Project Overview

Circle Drawer is a simple Java Swing–based desktop application that demonstrates the core concepts of GUI development, event handling, and custom drawing in Java. The application allows users to draw filled circles at random positions inside a drawing panel and clear all drawings using interactive buttons.

## Objectives

- To understand Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, and JButton  
- To implement event handling using the ActionListener interface  
- To perform custom drawing by overriding the paintComponent() method  
- To dynamically update the graphical interface using repaint()  
- To develop a basic interactive desktop application in Java  

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java  
- GUI Framework: Java Swing  
- Java Version: JDK 8 or higher  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans  


## Project Features

- Graphical user interface using Java Swing  
- “Draw Circle” button to draw filled circles at random positions  
- “Clear” button to remove all drawings from the panel  
- Custom drawing using Graphics class  
- Real-time UI updates based on user interaction  

## How to Run the Project

1. Install Java (JDK 8 or higher) on your system  
2. Clone or download the project source code  
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE  
4. Compile and run the `CircleDrawer.java` file  
5. The application window will appear  


## Program Behavior / Output

- A window titled **"Circle Drawer"** appears  
- Clicking **Draw Circle** draws a red filled circle at a random position  
- Multiple clicks result in multiple circles  
- Clicking **Clear** removes all circles and restores a blank panel  


## Analysis and Discussion

- The application demonstrates Java Swing GUI development using JFrame, JPanel, and JButton  
- Event handling is implemented using the ActionListener interface  
- Custom drawing is achieved by overriding the paintComponent() method  
- An ArrayList is used to manage multiple circle objects efficiently  
- The repaint() method ensures smooth and immediate graphical updates  


## Learning Outcomes

- Learned to create GUI applications using Java Swing  
- Understood event-driven programming concepts  
- Gained experience with custom graphics rendering  
- Learned how data structures interact with graphical components  
- Improved overall Java programming skills  


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic yet effective Java Swing application that combines GUI development, event handling, and custom drawing. The Circle Drawer application provides a practical understanding of how user interactions can dynamically control graphical output, making it a strong foundation for learning Java GUI programming.
